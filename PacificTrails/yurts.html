            <h3>What is a yurt?</h3>
            <p>
                Our luxury yurts are permanent structures 4 feet off the ground.
                Each yurt is fully enclosed with canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a
                roof dome that can be opened when wanted.

            <h3>How are the yurts furnished?</h3>
            <p>
                Each yurt is furnished with a queen size bed with a down quilt and a gas fired stove.
                Your luxury camping experience includes electricity, and a sink with hot and cold running water.
                Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.

            <h3>What should I bring?</h3>
            <p>
                Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for
                changing weather conditions with light layers of clothing. It's also
                helpful to bring a flashlight, and don't forget a sense of adventure!
